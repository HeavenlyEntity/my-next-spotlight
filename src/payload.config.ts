         node-postgres defaults to max 10 per pool, and `next build` fans out
         one worker per core -- each with its own pool -- so the build asks
         for several times the ceiling and dies with EMAXCONNSESSION part way
         through prerendering. It gets worse with every page added to
         generateStaticParams, which is a nasty way to find out.

         Two is enough here: a request does its queries in sequence, and a
         second connection only helps when two run concurrently in one
         instance. Raise it with DATABASE_POOL_MAX if the pooler plan grows,
         and keep workers x max under the ceiling. */
