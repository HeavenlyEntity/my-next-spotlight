/* Whop's webhook, for the deposit that starts an engagement.
 *
 * Whop delivers at least once, in no particular order, and retries a non-2xx
 * for three days. So: verify, record once (the payment id is unique on the
 * purchases table, and a race on it is treated as the duplicate it is),
 * answer 200 for anything that is not a fault of ours. Only a failed write
 * gets a 500, because that is the one case where a retry helps.
 *
 * What is recorded: a Purchase with provider "whop", the service the plan
 * belongs to, the amount in cents, and the buyer's email. Nothing to deliver:
 * an engagement is scheduled with the client by hand, so fulfilment is
 * "not_required" from the start. The buyer gets a receipt with the booking
 * link and the owner gets a heads-up, because a deposit is a client, not a
 * download. */
