/*
 * The tech stack, with marks.
 *
 * Tabler because the project already depends on it, so this adds no bundle
 * and no second icon family. It is also the rare library that carries both
 * real brand marks and neutral glyphs, which matters here: Next.js and
 * Postgres have logos, SuiteScript and SDF have none and never will. A
 * brand-logo-only approach leaves holes in the middle of a row.
 *
 * Matched on keywords, not exact strings. These values are typed into a CMS
 * field: "Next.js" becomes "Next.js 16" the first time someone updates a
 * kit, and an equality map would quietly fall back to a generic glyph with
 * nobody the wiser. Longest pattern wins so "react" cannot claim
 * "react-native" or "TanStack React Query".

 * and flip with the theme -- still the right mark, still monochrome, still
 * visible. Technologies with no brand at all (SuiteScript, SDF) take ink
 * too, because inventing a colour for them would imply a brand that does
