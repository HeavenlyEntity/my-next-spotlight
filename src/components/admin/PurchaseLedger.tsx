/*
 * The numbers above the Purchases list.
 *
 * Free claims and paid orders share one collection, which is right -- both
 * are a kit delivered to a GitHub account, and both need the same invitation
 * to be chased when it fails. But it means the list alone cannot answer
 * "how many Lite kits went out this week", because a free claim and a $999
 * licence look identical until you read the amount column.
 *
 * `amount` is the discriminator: 0 is a free claim, anything else is a sale.
 * Creem never sees the free ones, and never sees the GitHub account on any of
 * them, so this is the only place the whole picture exists.
 *
 * Awaiting invite is first on purpose. It is the only number here that is a
 * job rather than a statistic: every one of those is a person who has been
 * promised repository access and does not have it yet.
