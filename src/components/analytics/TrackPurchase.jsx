/* Reports a completed Creem sale from the page the buyer lands on. Only the
   server can decide a sale is real -- it checks the purchase row is paid
   before rendering this -- so this component is deliberately dumb: it fires
   what it is given and decides nothing.

   The event id is the Creem request id, which is unique per checkout and
   identical on the webhook. A refresh of the landing page sends the same id
   again and Whop folds it into the one sale. Email is passed only when the
   page could verify who is looking (a signed link); the anonymous success
   page reports the sale without it. */
