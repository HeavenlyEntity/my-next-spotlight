 * "Copy the ask" — the ladder as sentences someone can send.

 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Both design reviewers rejected the results screen for the
 * same reason: it ended in a report. The reader arrives holding an offer and a
 * decision, reads a confident headline, and then has to translate three
 * numbers, two sources and a spread into their own words before anything
 * happens. This closes that gap. It is the primary action on the page.
 *
 * SENDABLE, NOT DUMPED. `briefForContact()` above is a labelled record for a
 * human advisor to read. This is prose the user can paste into a reply and
 * edit: every number carries the one sentence that defends it and the source
 * behind that sentence, because an ask without its reasoning is a demand.
 *
 * EXACT DOLLARS, NOT THE DISPLAY GRAIN. The screen says "$184k" because the
 * figures are tabular and scanned. A salary written down in a negotiation is
 * written in full.
