/*
 * Conversion events for the Whop Pixel.
 *
 * The snippet in the site layout installs `window.whop` before any page
 * script runs, and its `track` queues until s.js arrives -- so a call from a
 * component is never too early. Whop itself sends with `keepalive`, which is
 * what makes "fire, then redirect to Creem" safe: the request outlives the
 * page.
 *
 * Every event name lives here, once. Whop groups by the name string, so a
 * typo in one call site would report as a separate, empty funnel step and
 * nobody would notice for weeks. The standard names (`lead`, `schedule`,
 * `purchase`, `view_content`) are the ones Whop forwards to ad platforms as
 * their native events; the custom ones are ours and stay inside Whop.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT tracked: anything Whop can see for itself. There
 * is nothing of that kind here yet -- checkout is Creem, not Whop -- but if
 * a Whop checkout is ever added, do not fire `purchase` for it. Whop records
 * its own sales and rejects the duplicate.
