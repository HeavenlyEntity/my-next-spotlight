# Whop Pixel events

The pixel snippet lives in `src/lib/analytics/whop-pixel.ts` and is rendered
into `<head>` by `src/app/(site)/layout.tsx`. Every event name lives in
`src/lib/analytics/whop.ts` (`WHOP_EVENT`); fire one with `whopTrack()`.

Rules that shaped this, from Whop's docs (`docs.whop.com/developer/ads/pixel`):

- **Never fire `purchase` for a sale Whop processed.** Creem is not Whop, so
  kit and download sales are the "own checkout" case Whop documents. The
  engagement deposits ARE Whop checkouts (`DepositCheckout`): Whop records
  and reports those itself, so nothing here fires `purchase` for them.
- **`purchase` needs a positive `value`.** `whopTrack` refuses to send one
  without it rather than let it fail on Whop's side.
- **`event_id` is per conversion, not per type.** Whop counts each
  `(name, event_id)` once, which is what makes a page refresh, a retried form
  or a re-sent claim collapse into one event. Use an id the system already
  has; never invent one at fire time.
- **Customer fields are plain text.** A hashed email is dropped as invalid.
- Whop sends with `keepalive`, so firing just before a redirect is safe.

Verifying: open `whop.com/dashboard/biz_PGSOCOwANQSket/websites`, walk the
funnel on the site, and watch the events arrive against the domain.
